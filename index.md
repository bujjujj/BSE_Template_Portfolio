# Third Eye for the Blind
I'm working on a third eye for the blind, which is a device utilizing multiple sensors hooked up to an arduino. The sensors give back information on the blind person's surroundings, making navigation easier.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was to complete a final prototype with all my sensors and devices working. During the time of my first milestone, I had only finished the code for my ultrasonic sensor, but during this second week, I added the buzzer code, as well as the temperature sensor code. So, I now have a fully working prototype, and one final device I want to add is the vibrating motor, as that will make communication with the blind person easier. I haven't added it yet, as it seems adding it will require some soldering, and so that will be done in the third week. Speaking of soldering, since my prototype is currently connected to the breadboard, I plan to solder everything together to make something more permanent, doing this also in the third week.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was to assemble my first prototype, and get started with the code. The first week was mainly filled with familiarization, as I was dealing with new parts I had never dealt with before, and approaching an unfamiliar subject for me. Learning how everything connected seemed like a daunting task at first, however, after I learned that jumper wires were the major connectors, I realized that assembling my project was just like assembling a more complicated lego set. The sensors in my first prototype include the ultrasonic sensor and the temperature sensor, and I'm using a buzzer along with a vibrating motor to signal to the blind person when something is too close or of an extreme temperature. I had also originally planned to completely follow the original project design, but I quickly realized that the parts I had were different from those the original designer used, so I had to make my own modifications to the design.
